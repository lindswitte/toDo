# The Todo List (first of many)

## 1. Based on circus-starter
So clone a download a copy of this repository, open terminal, `cd` into the folder, `npm install`, and `gulp` to get it going.

## 2. Make a working todo list.
Type in the box, click add, it goes on the list. Check the box, it dissappears. Easy!

## 3. Add extra features
Make it keep the counters at the bottom up-to-date. Make the 'clear finished items' button work.
